        Hello! I'm Jocelyn, a passionate and dedicated young Latina woman
        embarking on an exciting journey into the world of technology. Over the
        past year, I've been fervently immersing myself in the realm of web
        development, driven by a desire to transition into a fulfilling career
        as a Full Stack Web Developer.
      </p>
      <br></br>

      <p>
        My learning journey began as a self-taught enthusiast, exploring the
        fundamentals of coding and building a solid foundation. Eager to
        accelerate my growth, I enrolled in a bootcamp course with Southern
        Methodist University, a renowned institution known for its comprehensive
        tech programs. Throughout this transformative experience, I've dived
        deep into the intricacies of the MERN stack, honing my skills in
        MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
        I am thrilled and well-prepared to embark on my career in web
        development. My journey has equipped me with a robust understanding of
        coding fundamentals and the practical application of the MERN stack.
        Now, I am actively seeking an entry-level position where I can
        contribute my skills, continue learning, and make a meaningful impact in
        the dynamic world of technology.
